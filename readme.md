# CMPT 432
## JavaCompiler

## Project 3:

### What Works:
Inits: all types
Assignments: all types
Printing: all types
If and while: int comparisons 
If and while: boolean comparisons
If and while: var comparisons

### Not Working:
If and while: String comparisons
Boolean hell

### Buggy:
nested ifs in Whiles and vice versa(Upwards Jumps)
The issues occur depending on the what the ifs and whiles are doing.

### About:
This Compiler will Take Alan++(http://labouseur.com/courses/compilers/grammar.pdf)
and run it on(http://labouseur.com/commondocs/operating-systems/SvegOS/public_html/index.html)
which is a version of a 6502a OS


### Thoughts:
I'm fairly tired at this point, and cannot mentally make any more changes without ruining code.
At this time the project is done to the point of handing it off for grading.
I know it isn't perfect, but I worked my butt off and learned a ton.
If I get any spare time I might come back to this and fix up the outlying issues.
Signing off from Junior Year.
Thanks for a great class
